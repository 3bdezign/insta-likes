# insta-likes
macros to be used with the browser extension "ui.vision"

the "insta-likes" macro will like the most recent 5 posts on one profile
it will cycle thro 13 profiles that you select and usually takes 2mins finish
you can run it as many times as you want on as many profiles as you 

the "insta-like-all" macro will like all the posts on one profile (tested 800+)

# howto

- you have to open each profile you want to like pictures on in a new tab (2.png)

- an easy way to do this, is to open a list of followers or a list of 
likes on a picture.(4.png) you can scroll down the list and while holding ctrl and just click 
on profiles which will then open each profile open in a new tab. 
(the reason this part is manually done is so you can pick more carefully which 
profiles you will like pictures on, instead of liking a bunch of dead profiles pics)
(12-15 tabs is usually what most machines can handle at one time)

- now select the first tab in your browser (2.png)

- finnally in the ui.vision window at the top click "play macro"
