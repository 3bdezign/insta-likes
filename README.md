# HOW TO 

## you must open each account in its own new tab.(2.png)

- an easy way to do this may be to open a list of followers or a list of 
likes on a post.(4.png) and scroll down the list while holding ..ctrl.. and then ..click.. 
on the accounts you wish to like posts on and each will be opened in a new tab. 

## now select the first tab in your browser (2.png)

## now in the "ui.vision" window at the top click "play macro" and step back

# KNOWN ISSUES

15 tabs is usually what most pcs or the browsers can handle at a time
so you must close the tabs the tabs when it completes the macro.\
(will update macro too close all tabs when completed some day)

**this is manually done right now by me so i can cherry pick which 
accounts too like posts on.  
you can easily edit the macro allow the input of a ".csv" file containting acct names

do not use the mouse while macro is running(cursor will rubberband)
